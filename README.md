# CBDC-ScamCoin
CBDC Simulation Project

White Paper Introduction

Purpose: 

A social experiment to observe how people will put money into a speculative asset that even the creator advises against. Warning, don’t buy this coin. It’s a centralized currency that can fail at any time.  It’s a CBDC and I as a private individual am the issuing central bank.

Problem:

Cryptocurrencies can be created from thin air and assigned any value that the creator chooses.  They attain real value when people “invest” in them but only for the creator.  It’s a zero-sum game: net change in wealth for all participants is zero.  The house always wins.

Hypothesis:

CBDCs and fiat currencies are just shitcoins.
