# CBDC-ScamCoin
CBDC Simulation Project

White Paper Introduction

Purpose: 

A social experiment to observe how people will put money into a speculative asset that even the creator advises against. Warning, don’t buy this coin. It’s a centralized currency that can fail at any time.  It’s a CBDC and I as a private individual am the issuing central bank.

Problem:

Cryptocurrencies can be created from thin air and assigned any value that the creator chooses.  They attain real value when people “invest” in them but only for the creator.  It’s a zero-sum game: net change in wealth for all participants is zero.  The house always wins.

Hypothesis:

CBDCs and fiat currencies are just shitcoins.

Observations:

Some cryptocurrencies have actual intrinsic value.  The cypher-punks of the 1990s were really onto something. Blockchain technology is an incredibly powerful tool for data management and proof of authenticity.  It’s the perfect technology for finance and the storage and transmission of wealth across vast distances.  Almost everyone knows of the first successful deployment of a decentralized blockchain ledger “Bitcoin”.  If you haven’t read beyond Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, you should.  It’s the most groundbreaking work in economic theory since John Maynard Keans’ “The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money” and most earthshaking event in economics since the US decoupled the dollar from the gold standard.
